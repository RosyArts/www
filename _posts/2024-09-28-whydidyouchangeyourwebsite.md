So If you have been paying attention to me for whatever reason, than you may have noticed that I changed my website. I did this for a few reasons: mainly because I wanted to but also because I was inspired by [TodePond's website](https://todepond.com), not just it's design, but moreso it's codebase. My previous website was made in Sveltekit and was hosted on Vercel which was honestly overkill for how simple it was, and how little content was actually on it.
