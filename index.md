# Tristie's Nook

Hi there, my name is Tristie (or just Tris) and I'm a web developer who likes to build random stuff and put it on the internet. Some of my code, including this website, can be found [on Github](https://github.com/Tristie){: target="_blank"}. This website doubles as a longform [TLOGâ„¢](/tlog), however if you are looking for quick statuses, check out [my status.cafe](https://status.cafe/users/tristie){: target="_blank"}.

I like to take photos as well so hopefully I start posting those pictures here.
